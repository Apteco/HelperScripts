Here do you find whole packaged scripts for specific use cases:

Name|Description
-|-
newsystem|If you have a global user database then this script helps you to add the first user `administrator` for that system to the global user database. Afterwards you can login with that user and add more users from the global user inventory. Just download the whole folder `newsystem`, open the `new_admin_for_new_system.ps1` to change some settings (normally only the sqlserver instance) in `$settings` and then you are good to go to execute that script. It then asks you for the new systemname and the administrator entries will be created.
