Here do you find whole packaged scripts for specific use cases:

Name|Description
-|-
newsystem|If you have a global user database then this script helps you to add the first user `administrator` for that system to the global user database. Afterwards you can login with that user and add more users from the global user inventory. Just download the whole folder `newsystem`, open the `new_admin_for_new_system.ps1` to change some settings (normally only the sqlserver instance) in `$settings` and then you are good to go to execute that script. It then asks you for the new systemname and the administrator entries will be created.
filewatcher|Create an automatic "Watchdog" to do something with files if they are getting created/deleted/changed etc. on a specific directory. This example is looking at a folder and looking for new files, waiting until the file has finally arrived and move it then to another place.
csv-to-sqlite|This script is looking for a specific directory and load all text files in a sqlite database. If that database or the tables in it or the columns in a table do not exist, they will be created automatically. Existing tables will be appended with the new data.
filewaiter|This Script watches a specific folder and is waiting for 1 or multiple files to arrive. If this happens, a countdown will be started automatically. If another files arrives before the countdown is finished, the countdown will be reset. If the countdown is finally finished, it triggers another script (like importing the data into a database and then trigger a build).<br/>After the scripts have been finished it gets back to the waiting mode until a new file will arrive.<br/><br/>With this approach we can make sure that a build runs even if some files are not arriving due to technical problems.
